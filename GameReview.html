        An utter masterpiece, between the soundtrack, art, and bosses, Terraria is easily a top 5 2D game.

        A prehistoric experience where you can tame dinosaurs like Pokemon, find mythical creatures, and slay bosses. Multiplayer provides a much heightened experience.

        With its charming art style, Don't Starve is a struggle against the elements and the darkness. Balancing hunger and sanity needs provides a real challenge.

        <p>
        Have you ever watched "Honey I Shrunk the Kids?", well imagine you're the kid and now you have to survive in a scientists backyard. The fear that a wolf spider induces when you have nothing but a pebble and a torch is exhilarating. Sequel in development.

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>
        DayZ is a post apocalyptic survival game with zombies where players scavenge anything they can find before they get their brains devoured or someone takes them out. Lots of walking, however.

        This game is a mashup of Ark Survival and Pokemon in one, with a massive open world, Palworld provides a great new play experience with dozens of hours of gameplay.

        <p>
        Valheim is the perfect game for those who want to slay beasts as a viking. Between the Runescape-like level up system and the sheer difficulty the land poses, Valheim is a survival must play.

        <p>
        A very simple survival game setting in the Amazon rain forest. The combat is a bit tricky however, once mastered the game isn't much of a challenge. Resource management becomes a bit of a chore.

        This game is a refreshing survival experience, as you work your way through an alien infested underground research facility, you will come across various anomalies that take you to different dimensions that provide new resources to advance your base or arsenal.

        <p>
        No mans sky didn't have the greatest release, but it is now renowned as the most ambitious space exploration game to date. From custom ships and frigates, to breath taking planets, this game has one of the largest open worlds in gaming with over 200 galaxies and millions of explorable systems.
