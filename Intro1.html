		<h2>Future</h2>
		<p>Future goals after college include trying to secure a penetration testing job and accrue all necessary certifications to keep rising in the field.</p>
		<p>What inspires me to become one with my major is just simply having the ability to make something like a robot or an application that can simplify someone life aswell holding the knowledge to do certain things that other people arent willing to put in the time to learn. I discovered this at Diman Regional programming small sensor bots on top of my own self discovery within video game coding and commands.<p>
		<p>With the given resources I have concluded that I am a hands on learner, I have the ability to absorb info through words but the retention is far less then when i am able to either see an example, or I explore everything within certain parameters to be thorough before moving on, this can be applied to this course spcifically because we learn something new followed by proof and then immediatley use those skills in assignments such as this one.</p>
		<p>I am pretty lucky to have such flexible time managment as it has never really been an issue, I take care of all my assignments immediatley in the morning, I have established with my workplace that I take courses and they accomodate appropriately, any spare time which is frequent is used for extra studying or hobbies.</p>
